      <h2 id="goleft">About David</h2>

      <section id="bio">
        <p>
          David grew up in pre-developed Flagstaff, Arizona and there is where
          his love of the outdoors began to blossom. His family, including six
          other siblings, spent their play time in the mountains and forests- in
          fact David has often joked that Mount Elden (located in the Four Peaks
          Wilderness) was their backyard. However, while his interest in the
          outdoors started young, it truly began to blossom in his adulthood.
          After getting married to his beautiful wife, Kristine, and graduating
          from Brigham Young University with an undergrad in English and then
          from BYU's law school with a Jurist Doctorate, their family life
          began.
        </p>

        <p>
          While David found his professional life fulfilling, he still found his
          appetite for adventure going unsatisfied. Weekends became reserved for
          Arizona exploration, and five kids and three grand kids later, David
          still finds himself hiking to the tops of peaks all over Arizona. Only
          now, he wants to share the peace and beauty he finds in the brilliant
          outdoors with those around him. While his original intentions were
          never to brag about his experiences, it seems that as he shares them
          people have begun to recognize the unique perspective he brings to the
          world of nature photography. David hopes to continue sharing his love
          of nature with those around him and plans on continuing to enjoy the
          great outdoors for as long as he can!
